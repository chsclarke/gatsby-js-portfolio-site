# gatsby-js-portfolio-site

This repo is meant to be a quick, **free**, and easy to deploy resume website builder. The webiste is fully built, configred, and ready to be deployed. All **you** have to do is edit the config.js file to see this site become your own.

See a live demo of my webiste [here](chaseclarke.com)
